Like how everyone has a lifeline where their actions are recorded subconsciously, such as one's first create, first love, first house, milestones shape an individual and help them grow. Similarly, Version Control helps us go back to a point in the software code timeline to track, revert, or identify which changes contributed to errors or mishaps.\n\n> What is Git?\n\nGit is a modern version control system that is mature, actively maintained, and open-source. It is a technology that implements the idea of Version Control. Platforms such as GitHub and GitLab provide developers with functionalities to efficiently work in a team.\n\n#### GitHub\n\nGitHub is a Microsoft-owned proprietary version control platform that was previously a completely open-source project. It was famous among a large group of software developers and beginner engineers as a whole. However, after its acquisition by Microsoft, several public favorite functionalities were threatened, and their quality has become questionable.\n\n#### GitLab\n\nGitLab is an open-source version control platform that can be redeveloped and redistributed with a higher degree of customizable features. It is an ideal case of a DevOps implementation platform that supports Continuous Integration and Development (CI/CD). GitLab also offers team-friendly and productive features.\n\n### Is Verision Control and Git as a technology important to learn?\n\nIn my experience, before a beginner embarks on the journey of learning a technology or a framework, I would suggest learning the basics and functionalities of a platform such as Git. This is because there is practically no credible way of transferring knowledge to someone about how much a person has worked over time. Having a continuous presence on a platform like this and being able to showcase learnings and contributions to other technologies is an asset. Platforms like these allow individuals to showcase their skills and contributions, unlike certificates, which many of my peers seek.\n\nI regret not being so active on platforms like these in my earlier stages, which could have led me to become a confident and successful contributor. Developing the habit of being active on these platforms is a challenge, but it's worth the effort. Any good platform or technology not only brings direct functionality but also a range of other scope of developments to a person. In this case, it brings a sense of scale for anyone, such as how many things are yet to learn and what the people around are up to. It also has a team maintaining functionality to it, where you can assign and manage the issue within a project, which, if not drastically, increases the team's productivity. It is also a good tool to track progress and avoid ambiguity.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nAt the end of the day, a person's own will is the driving factor of their learning and progress, but having a good hand on some platforms like these exposes us to the world in real terms. It drives individuals to learn further and expand their knowledge, creating a sense of healthy competition. There is no harm in that.\n\n### References\n\n- [Learn Github](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/git-and-github-learning-resources)\n\n- [Learn GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/learn/)\n\n- [What' Git?](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/what-is-git)","src/content/blog/Version-Control.mdx","26dd50e604fd8293","Version-Control.mdx",true,"making-hugo-site",{id:22,data:24,body:30,filePath:31,digest:32,legacyId:33,deferredRender:21},{title:25,description:26,imagePath:27,date:28,metaPath:29},"How to Build Hugo Site","This is a blog post on Hugo website building","/src/images/cover/Hugo.png","June 09, 2022","/images/covers/Hugo.png","## How to make a Hugo web application\n\nHugo is one of the most popular open-source static site generators. With its amazing speed and flexibility, Hugo makes building websites fun again.\n\nSo in short this site is very much created using hugo and a custom [theme](\"https://github.com/adityatelange/hugo-PaperMod/\" 'The theme repository on GitHub'). This site is been built on linux(Zorin OS) so the commands and steps been followed can be different for the OS changes.\n\n### Installing Hugo\n\nTo install hugo on your machine you can use the following command\n\n`sudo snap install hugo`\n\n### Making a new site\n\nWe have to locally create a new hugo application in order to develop it as per our requirements. To to initialize a new hugo application we have to enter the following command\n\n`hugo new site <Your site name> -f yml`\n\nIn the above like we created a new direcotry on the path with the name of your site.\n\nThis is broken down as follows:\n\n- `-f`: is used to represent that we are formating the existing format of config file\n- `yml`: is used to specify the config file type `yml` is preferred over `toml` because it is easy to read.\n\nNow we should enter the directory using `cd <Your site name>` command.\n\n### Extracting the Paper-Mod Theme\n\nThe Theme used on this site the [Paper-Mod](https://github.com/adityatelange/hugo-PaperMod/ 'the link duh') needs to be extracted into the working Project in order to use it.\n\nTo acheive this we have to execute some more commands as follows\n\n- `git clone https://github.com/adityatelange/hugo-PaperMod themes/PaperMod --depth=1`\n\nthis will clone the theme into the `themes` folder.\n\n- `cd themes/PaperMod`\n\nWe will change our directory to the theme directory.\n\n- `git pull`\n\nWe are now checking for and due updates of the theme if there are any updates to be made this command will pull those updates into the current working directory.\n\n### Adding New pages to our Site\n\nSo that our page is now setup with custom theme and all we need to add some pages to is so that people can be able to read it. Like it is reason for which we are making a site now to create new pages with default template we need to enter the following lines of command on the terminal.\n\n`hugo new posts/my-first-post.md`\n\nYou can create various pages by changing the page name all the pages of this site will be inside the `content/` directory.\nThis will create a new page on the posts section in with page name as my-first-post.\n\nSince we have added pages we need to edit it right because we have used `.md` so we need to edit these markdown files which are a piece of cake to do you can see the procedure of how to edit markdown files [here✌️](https://www.w3schools.io/file/markdown-introduction/ 'link for tutorial').\n\n### Setting up config File\n\nWe need to also setup a `config.yml` file change the deafult look of the theme and to initialize the theme. We need to enter the root directory of the hugo application, there should be an existing config file we need to add the following contents to it.\n\n```\nbaseURL: \"https://examplesite.com/\"\ntitle: ExampleSite\npaginate: 5\ntheme: PaperMod\n\nenableRobotsTXT: true\nbuildDrafts: false\nbuildFuture: false\nbuildExpired: false\n\ngoogleAnalytics: UA-123-45\n\nminify:\n  disableXML: true\n  minifyOutput: true\n\nparams:\n  env: production # to enable google analytics, opengraph, twitter-cards and schema.\n  title: ExampleSite\n  description: \"ExampleSite description\"\n  keywords: [Blog, Portfolio, PaperMod]\n  author: Me\n  # author: [\"Me\", \"You\"] # multiple authors\n  images: [\"<link or path of image for opengraph, twitter-cards>\"]\n  DateFormat: \"January 2, 2006\"\n  defaultTheme: auto # dark, light\n  disableThemeToggle: false\n\n  ShowReadingTime: true\n  ShowShareButtons: true\n  ShowPostNavLinks: true\n  ShowBreadCrumbs: true\n  ShowCodeCopyButtons: false\n  ShowWordCount: true\n  ShowRssButtonInSectionTermList: true\n  UseHugoToc: true\n  disableSpecial1stPost: false\n  disableScrollToTop: false\n  comments: false\n  hidemeta: false\n  hideSummary: false\n  showtoc: false\n  tocopen: false\n\n  assets:\n    # disableHLJS: true # to disable highlight.js\n    # disableFingerprinting: true\n    favicon: \"<link / abs url>\"\n    favicon16x16: \"<link / abs url>\"\n    favicon32x32: \"<link / abs url>\"\n    apple_touch_icon: \"<link / abs url>\"\n    safari_pinned_tab: \"<link / abs url>\"\n\n  label:\n    text: \"Home\"\n    icon: /apple-touch-icon.png\n    iconHeight: 35\n\n  # profile-mode\n  profileMode:\n    enabled: false # needs to be explicitly set\n    title: ExampleSite\n    subtitle: \"This is subtitle\"\n    imageUrl: \"<img location>\"\n    imageWidth: 120\n    imageHeight: 120\n    imageTitle: my image\n    buttons:\n      -

HITAM\n* Head of Google Technologies - GDSC HITAM\n* Student Faculty - SSG HITAM\n* Student Dean Doing Engineering - SSG HITAM\n\nThese experiences on a great part wouldn't have been possible if not for the nurturing and progressive environment of **[Hyderabad Institute of Technology and Management](https://www.linkedin.com/school/hitamhyderabad/posts/?feedView=all)**. And also because of the supportive friends, and seniors I came across who belived in me specially at times when I didn't belived in myself.\n\nPeople are a great part all the things you do in college, the one's who support you and especially the one's who stand in your way making you question about yourself.\n\n## Being Coordinator at 2nd year in college\n\nSo if you don't know this there is a concept of either going the normal way doing intermediate and enter the engineering path, and also there is this method of getting a diploma and entering the world of under-grad engineering where you don't have to do 1st year of college instead enter at 2nd year of the course. The work becomes cut out for you don't have to do all of that physics and chem at your late teens instead you can just focus the engineering concepts.\n\nBut with it's up's there is a significant down to the whole thing, that all the folks have already jelled and it becomes difficult to enter social groups and setting. It's not bad on a great scale but has a **make or break** phase to it where you decide who you wanna be. Either shelled up or go out with your social ammo on people, the approach I chose was the later one. I tried to talk to folks and explain 'em who I am and asking is there a way to find like minded people.\n\nAfer asking a handful of people you understand which place you want to be at, It takes a while before people start noticing and give you responsibilities. It took a while for me too, where after getting responsibilty of being the Head of Technologies at GDSC HITAM I was called upon to head one of the affinity clubs of our college, where the club which was started by our super - seniors(allegedly the right term). Where this club has seen a down time, and we were supposed to revive it and get it up and running, with another guy who was my Coordinator-mate.\n\n### Things we did\n\nWe just got up and running, and held our first session about version-control. where we were quite a hit, but I made a lot of mistakes as speaker, I understood that it is not about what you want to explain, but is about how much the audience, can comprehend and gain from it.\n\nThen there was another issue I faced, was sharing of responsibilities where my mate was preparing for a significant exam, and has said he wouldn't be able to contribute much. And I myself had all the time in the world and wanted to weave this community in my college which will all about coding. So instead of shying away and letting him be a silent mate, I made sure he was leaving the post and giving me flexibility of what I wanted to do with the club.\n\nThen the stream roller started, first of all I wanted all the social media access, and wanted to make sure of everything we do is going to be accessable and could be followed, so I got us various social media profiles, and also made a website which can be used to understand the sessions. It was the most inspiring work I have done, with the least experience and as it goes, it was not a very efficient work.\n\n[Coding Club HITAM website](https://coding-hitam.github.io/)\n\nDuring my stint as a Coordinator, After organising a handful of sessions, I was trying to come up  with a team to keep on with the sessions, and to manage all the terinary works and turned out I was pretty bad at it, I was not able to communicate and forge a relation of trust and passsion, which I belived in. What ended up happening was team members were not incentivized to conduct a session and attract a lot of participant which caused us to blow off into the dust.\n\nThings I learnt were, if you create a team develop a synergy with them and have them on the same wavelength, and also while organizing bigger events don't loose a touch of your community and manage the work. And if people don't show up in huge numbers doesn't mean you should stop rather make the session and interaction useful for the one's who showed up.\n\n## Google Developers Student Group - HITAM","src/content/blog/college-experience.mdx","0000f10ff5775773","college-experience.mdx","ai-revolution",{id:45,data:47,body:55,filePath:56,digest:57,legacyId:58,deferredRender:21},{title:48,description:49,imagePath:50,metaPath:50,tags:51,date:54,isDraft:21},"AI Revolution","This is an article expressing my thoughts around the surge of ai in the recent times","/src/images/cover/ai-revolution.jpeg",[52,53],"AI","Cloud computing","April 06, 2025","# The Rise","src/content/blog/ai-revolution.mdx","ab0c54b3eaf37973","ai-revolution.mdx","eco-friendly",{id:59,data:61,body:67,filePath:68,digest:69,legacyId:70,deferredRender:21},{title:62,description:63,imagePath:64,date:65,metaPath:66},"What is Eco-Friendly?","This is an article dicussing what is ecofriendly.","/src/images/cover/eco.jpg","June 09, 2023","/images/covers/eco.jpg","## Introduction\n\nWhile I was using metro for my daily commute a question popped into my mind, Is the metro eco-firendly? What is eco-friendly? Is something making run on electricity eco-friendly?, So there is this vague idea that changing the source of energy to electric makes it carbon neutral which is **GOOD**, but is it? Isn't it a fact that the maximum electricity production based on thermal energy stations. Is that the optimal way of doing things??\n\n## The Problem!\n\nSo the issue the one we are facing, atleast I am is the question **What is Eco-friendly**? Because currently in India maximum electricity production is based on thermal energy. So i did the most simplest thing I could have done just a web search so here what returned...\n\n![Initial Search](/images/blogs/eco-friendly/1.png)\n\n\nSo if you see there are some points stated here and the details are very vague in nature they try to give you the mental perception of it being a eco-friendly way of travel but it dosen't give you any positive or conclusive data. The terms used are very uncertain at a glance.\n\n- 10,000 tons of CO2 removal if taken as mode of public transport by the commutors.\n\n- 200 tons of volatile organic compounds, and 12 tons of particulate matter to be reduced.\n\n- 5,000 CO2 will be removed from the surrounding because of the [Rolling Stock](https://www.ltmetro.in/hyderabad-metro-rail/project-highlights/rolling-stock/).\n\n- Saving $5,000,000 environmental damage cost which would have cost due to the harmful gases.\n\nThose are some bold statements and they make you feel good. But a question that comes to once mind is are they actually good? or are they too good to be true ?\n\nAmong all other questions in my mind like\n\n- How are they removing the carbon from the space?\n\n- How much are they rellying on the existing grid, which is on thermal source to be true?\n\n- And how did they cover the carbon they emmited during the construction?\n\n#### For the purpose of this article lets just look at how eco-friendly is Hyderabad Metro Network and How much of the Indian power network is dependent on fossil fuel?\n\nLet's have a look at what I found and my views on them.\n\n## The Unseen Reality\n\n- #### How much was the carbon footprint of the construction work of Hyderbad Metro Network?\n\n  - Around 1.2 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) was released as a direct result of the construction of the Hyderabad Metro Rail.\n\n  - The construction of the Hyderabad Metro Rail also generated around 100,000 tonnes of construction waste. This waste was mostly disposed of in landfills, which released methane, a potent greenhouse gas.\n\n- #### How much of the metro's power supply requirements rely on renewable source of energy?\n\n  - HMRP(Hyderbad Metro Rail Project) has a continuous cooperations with **Amp Energy India** which has installed and commitioned solar panel on the rooftop of the stations, the following article states it has been in operation from 26th December 2022 which will supply the **15% of the power requirements**. I just wonder where the rest of the power comes from i.e:**85%**.\n\n    {' '}\n    {/* <Button\n    \toutlined\n    \thref=\"https://ampenergyindia.com/companynews/amp-energy-india-powers-lt-metro-rail-hyderabad-with-solar/\"\n    >\n    \tMore Details\n    </Button> */}\n    <br />\n\n  - **_Let's have a glance at the Indian power demographics which has been used by this network and the rest of the nation._**\n\n  ![Energy diversification](/images/blogs/eco-friendly/3.png)\n\n    The above is the split of Energy infrastructure in India as of 2023.\n\n  * The metro network and all other infracture which claim to be a Green Future are in practice depending on the existing infrastructure of electricity generation i.e: Thermal Power Plants. Thermal Power Plants themselves depend on non-renewable sources of energy. So the question here is What is Eco-Friendly in this context, as we are continuosly depleting are resources and claiming that the energy generated by these systems is somehow Eco-Friendly or Sustainable. Because I feel we are living in a dillusion that we are Eco-Friendly, without even knowing what it means.\n    <br />\n\n- #### How much carbon does HMRP remove from the environment?\n\n  - The Hyderabad Metro is estimated to remove about **1.2 million metric tons of carbon dioxide from the environment each year**. This is equivalent to taking about 240,000 cars off the road.\n\n  - In 2020, conventional modes of transportation were responsible for an estimated **12 million metric tons of carbon dioxide emissions** in the city.\n\n  - The main reason for this high level of emissions is the use of fossil fuels to power these vehicles. Cars and buses typically run on petrol or diesel, while two-wheelers often use petrol.\n\n  - But contrary to conventional modes of transport the metro network is not directly dependent on fossil fuel, instead is dependent on electricity which can be generated by other methods.\n\n## What I found out as positives?\n\n- #### How much time would it take for HMRP to remove the carbon it created and is continuing to emit?\n\n  - Hyderbad Metro Project removes approximately **1,000 tones of CO2 per day** from the environment by giving alternative to the existing conventional transport methods.\n\n  - In the current scenario of the HMRP it would take an esitamed **1,200 days** of operations to remove the standing pollution of the use of concrete alone, As of today, May 15, 2023, there have been **1182 working days and total number of days standing at 1,995 days** since November 28, 2017 the day of inception.Although while accounting for the number of days required to remove pollution cause by the metro we didn't consider the CFC footprint because of the air-conditioning used and the reliance on conventional methods of power to run daily operations which is **85%**.\n\n  - All of these power consumption cost are excluding the continous expansion of the metro and the incuring the construction cost.\n\n- #### Does having public transport infrastructure really help?\n\n  - **Yeah, it does** the inception of the metro projects, has removed alot of public transport from the street, on an usual basis. And has made the public use a releatively greener transport method by eluminating the carbon footprint generated by conventional methods of transport.\n\n  - I really think that the key to solving the problem of \"Is the upgradation of the of current public transport infrastructure a greener pursuit?\" is understanding that as more and more people opt for public transportation the carbon footprint which is almost **4463 Gg (Giga-gram) of CO2 per year** will be eliminated.\n\n  - If we can upgrade the existing public transport infrastructure in a sustainable manner, which is the only way to curb the carbon footprint of the indian urban landscape. Then only we can effectlively transisiton to a greener and healthy future.\n\n- #### How are other alternative to a greener future working?\n\n  - In general, public transport is more efficient than private cars in terms of fuel consumption and emissions. For example, a study by the Indian Institute of Technology Bombay found that a metro train can carry the same number of passengers as 4,000 cars, but it produces only 10% of the emissions.\n\n  - As a result, upgrading public transport can lead to significant reductions in carbon emissions. For example, a study by the World Bank found that upgrading public transport in Delhi could reduce carbon emissions by up to 20%.\n\n  - The Delhi Metro has reduced carbon emissions by an estimated **1.5 million tonnes per year**.\n\n  - The Mumbai Metro has reduced carbon emissions by an estimated **1 million tonnes per year**.\n\n  - The Bangalore Metro has reduced carbon emissions by an estimated **0.5 million tonnes per year**.\n\n  - Chennai Monorail is estimated to reduce carbon emissions by **100,000 tonnes per year**.\n\n## Conclusion\n\n- There is lack of understanding over the use of the term Eco-Friendly which needs to be clarified.\n\n- General public should be aware that just changing something to electric modes of power doesn't make it Eco-Friendly.\n\n- But at the same time I also came to know that the approach to direct solution for the emissions caused by private transport and methods likewise, will be solved by upgrading the public transit infrastructure. But when the construction space in our nation and state,don't understand the need of having a sustainable method of doing operations, more projects like these can do more harm than being helpful.\n\n- Making sustainable construction is a long path to go,I acknowledged that it is not an easy path to take,but iw ould also point out that one point of time solar energy was not the most efficient, and feasible way of generating electricity has now become of the most efficient and cheap thing to do.\n\n![Cost of renewable](/images/blogs/eco-friendly/4.jpg)\n\n- India has been transitioning from conventional to the renewable energy source over time which has been great but the pace can be imporved.\n\n![India renewable](/images/blogs/eco-friendly/India_renewable_electricity_production.svg.png)\n\n- We as a community should be more optimistic and supportive towards the idea of upgrading the existing public transport infrastructure, instead of raising demands of upgrading the private vehicle transit system. This way we can decrease the number of cars and bikes on our roads, and curb more carbon emission.\n\n### Sources\n\n- [https://www.iea.org/data-and-statistics/charts/co2-emissions-from-the-indian-energy-sector-2019](https://www.iea.org/data-and-statistics/charts/co2-emissions-from-the-indian-energy-sector-2019)\n\n- [https://powermin.gov.in/en/content/power-sector-glance-all-india](https://powermin.gov.in/en/content/power-sector-glance-all-india)\n\n- [Wikipedia Image](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renewable_energy_in_India#/media/File:India_renewable_electricity_production.svg)\n\n- [https://www.ceew.in/publications/india-transport-energy-use-carbon-emissions-and-decarbonisation](https://www.ceew.in/publications/india-transport-energy-use-carbon-emissions-and-decarbonisation)\n\n- [Hindu Article](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/hyderabad-metro-rail-has-carried-208-crore-riders-saved-47-crore-litres-of-fuel-since-its-inception/article37749081.ece)\n\n- \"Hyderabad Metro Rail: A Case Study of Sustainable Urban Transportation\" by The Energy and Resources Institute (TERI)\n\n- [https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/life-after-a-metro-less-traffic-but-more-co2/story-ExZqP7aSGJLDHKTanA0pOJ.html](https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/life-after-a-metro-less-traffic-but-more-co2/story-ExZqP7aSGJLDHKTanA0pOJ.html)","src/content/blog/eco-friendly.mdx","dd83550106929b41","eco-friendly.mdx","work",["Map",73,74,89,90,101,102,116,117],"routio",{id:73,data:75,body:85,filePath:86,digest:87,legacyId:88,deferredRender:21},{title:76,description:77,imagePath:78,metaPath:79,tags:80,date:84},"Routio","This is an article about a project on route optimization.","/src/images/cover/Routio.png","/images/covers/Routio.png",[81,82,83],"Monorepo","Next.js","DjangoRestFramework","June 10, 2024","You can access the application from [**here**](https://routio.vercel.app/)\n\n## Understanding the Challenge\n\nWaste management in modern cities involves complex logistics. Variations in waste volumes, dynamic traffic conditions, and the capacity of disposal points all contribute to the complexity. My goal was clear: develop a system that dynamically optimizes waste collection routes in real-time, ensuring efficiency and sustainability.\n\n## Development process\n\nSince there were 2 aspects to this projects, I researched on employing an efficient way to manage either aspects of the project i.e, Frontend and Backend. Where upon Research I stumbled upon the concept of MonoRepo.\n\n### MonoRepo\n\n> A monorepo is a single repository containing multiple distinct projects, with well-defined relationships.[^1]\n\nAfter thorough research, I understood that this technology and philosophy allow both the frontend and backend to be hosted on a single application. This setup enables them to run simultaneously, significantly reducing the complexity of managing two separate applications, their versions, and their codebases, all with a unified approach.\n\nAfter choosing Next.js and Tailwind CSS for my frontend and Django Rest Framework for my backend, TurboRepo was the obvious choice for the monorepo framework due to its seamless integration with Next.js. The entire unified repository was hosted on [GitLab](https://gitlab.com) for its easy and accessible issue tracking and collaboration features.\n\n### Software LifeCycle\n\n![Development-WorkFlow](/images/work/Routio/SDC.png)\n\nSince the Proposed Application was going to handle multiple aspects simultaneously, and had equally sizable workloads for the frontend and backend, It was essential for having a very simple and straight forward software development stratergy. Since the aspects of projects were having multiple aspects such as,\n\n**Frontend**: Map, Plotting of Routes on Map, handling multiple users, Responsive View...etc.\n\n**Backend**: Multiple users, Entity relations, Data processing, Role Based Rendering...etc\n\nIt was obvious that a single branch will not be an efficient way to approach it so I settled on having 2 production branches namely,\n\n**main** : The og, which will host both Frontend and Backend latet codes, and the `apps\\frontend` folder will be used to deploy the application on [vercel.com](https://vercel.com).\n\n**\\_backend**: This Branch will be having the latest backend code but will not have the latest frontend code and will be hosted on [pythonanywhere.com](https://www.pythonanywhere.com/) to host the APIs.\n\nAnd the development cycle was like this:\n\n1. **Issue** will be created describing the Feature required to be Developed, with label mentioned between `backend & frontend` defining the development branch.\n\n2. **Merge Request** was created by creating a branch targetted towards the target branch i.e, \\_brackend or main.\n\n3. **Development** was done on the created branch with developing the targetted feature and ability, and consecutive commits were made at every stage of development, after the feature was developed it was merged.\n\n4. **Pipeline** of vercel was used to build and check the frontend components before deployment, and then when it passed the checks the merge was accepted.\n\n## Login flow\n\nIn this Project instead of locally setting up the entire user management system, I have used Aut0[^2] to handle user sign up, where it allows users to signup using social accounts, such as `Google`. And it also enables to use **Role Based Access Control**[^3], which enables to show different views based on different Roles, since I was expecting 2 different types of users.\n\n1. <ins>User</ins> : This is the view of the normal user who will be cattered to\n   by the service.\n2. <ins>Driver</ins> : This is the view of the Driver who will be assigned to\n   various centers, and will be able to view the route it is supposed to take.\n\nIn the employed login, I have used 2 peripheral where,\n\n1. **Auth0** will handle and provide the user information and will handle the login and logout operations.\n2. **Local Database** will be storing the user information to be processed for the product, and has all the critical information for assigning them to centers, and figuring out which driver will cater to them.\n\nSo every time there is a login of user from auth0, there is a check if the user is in the database of the application, if not based on the role of the user defined by auth0 it is handled. The flow is visualized below and can be found at `apps/frontend/src/app/page.tsx`[^4].\n![Login-flow](/images/work/Routio/LoginFlow.png)\n\n## Frontend\n\nAt the frontend `Next.js` is being used, because of my familiarity with it and also because of it's ease of integration with `tailwind css`, before the frontend of the application was developed I researched and came up with a UI/UX design for how the product will be looking[^5], then the tough part of developing the frontend started.\n\nThe components to be developed were,\n\n1. Map section\n2. Routing Capability\n3. Green Impact - A section dedicated to display the vitals of the vehicle and viewing the CO<sup>2</sup> emissions.\n4. Profile View - To view the user details, and the logout capabilities were provided here.\n5. Hamburger Menu - A overflowing hamburger view to navigate to various locations and functionalities.\n\nAs illustrated below all the components were fed with the dedicated data, and were being rendered simultaneously instead of a monolothic render with changing components, and it was developed to be a SPA (Single-page application)[^6] for the primary functionalities. They can be viewed at [apps/frontend/src/app/[views]- Anirban Sikdar / routio-turborepo](https://gitlab.com/anirban-1009/routio-turborepo/-/tree/main/apps/frontend/src/app/%5Bviews%5D)\n\n| ![UserView-flow](/images/work/Routio/UserView.png) | ![DrvierView-flow](/images/work/Routio/DriverView.png) |\n| -------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |\n\n## Backend\n\nIn this project, I used Django Rest Framework (DRF) to manage database operations, including URL routing, viewsets, serializers, and models.\n\n1. **URLs**: Define endpoints for accessing resources, linking each pattern to a specific viewset.\n2. **Viewsets**: Handle HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) and interact with models and serializers to manage data.\n3. **Serializers**: Convert complex data types to and from native Python data types, facilitating validation and data transformation.\n4. **Models**: Define the database structure, specifying fields and behaviors for stored data.\n\nThe flow is as follows:\n\n1. URLs map the client's request to the appropriate viewset.\n2. Viewsets process the request, using models to fetch or modify data.\n3. Serializers convert data between the model and response format.\n\nThis setup ensures a clean separation of concerns, enhancing maintainability and scalability. Details can be found in `apps/backend/`[^7]\n![DRF](/images/work/Routio/DRF.png)\n\n## Screenshots\n\n| ![driver-main-view](/images/work/Routio/driver-main-view.png) | ![Green-impact](/images/work/Routio/Green-impact.png) | ![Login-screen](/images/work/Routio/Login-screen.png) | ![Menu-section](/images/work/Routio/Menu-section.png) |\n| ------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |\n\n## Impact and Future Directions\n\nMy waste management optimization system has already shown significant improvements in route efficiency and cost reduction. The user-friendly interface and real-time adaptability ensure that operations remain responsive and efficient.\n\nLooking ahead, I plan to incorporate advanced analytics and machine learning to further refine route optimization. Expanding my data sources to include weather forecasts and community feedback will help improve service quality and environmental sustainability.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nDeveloping this waste management optimization system has been a journey of innovation and perseverance. By integrating advanced optimization algorithms with real-time data and modern web technologies, I've created a solution that addresses the complex logistical challenges of urban waste management. My methodology and development process, grounded in best practices and continuous improvement, have been key to my success. I’m excited to continue evolving my system and contributing to more sustainable and efficient waste management practices.\n\n[^1]: [What is MonoRepo?](https://monorepo.tools/#what-is-a-monorepo)\n\n[^2]: [Learn the basics and begin building your authentication solution.](https://auth0.com/docs/get-started)\n\n[^3]: [Understand the concept of role-based access control and how it applies in Auth0.](https://auth0.com/docs/manage-users/access-control/rbac)\n\n[^4]: [apps/frontend/src/app/page.tsx · main · Anirban Sikdar / routio-turborepo · GitLab](https://gitlab.com/anirban-1009/routio-turborepo/-/blob/main/apps/frontend/src/app/page.tsx)\n\n[^5]: [Figma | Created with Figma](https://www.figma.com/design/cEM60uGEJU8MBgJlFgnxkC/Design?m=auto&t=7mME81Vba8815rhs-6)\n\n[^6]: [SPA (Single-page application) - MDN Web Docs Glossary: Definitions of Web-related terms | MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/SPA)\n\n[^7]: [apps/backend · main · Anirban Sikdar / routio-turborepo · GitLab](https://gitlab.com/anirban-1009/routio-turborepo/-/tree/main/apps/backend)","src/content/work/Routio.mdx","dbbc665db299ac07","Routio.mdx","aquaskimmer",{id:89,data:91,body:97,filePath:98,digest:99,legacyId:100,deferredRender:21},{title:92,description:49,imagePath:93,metaPath:93,tags:94,date:54,isDraft:21},"Aquaskimmer","/src/images/cover/aquaskimmer.png",[95,96],"IoT","RaspberryPi","# What is aquaskimmer?\n\nAquaskimmer is the flagship product of **Eunio Innovations**, it is an aquadrone which is used to fetch the foreign and harmful material from water bodies.\n\nIt was the project to which I was able contributed which eventually turned into my first internship experience.\n![the-drone](/images/work/aquaskimmer/the-drone.jpg)","src/content/work/aquaskimmer.mdx","00993314cc8f1042","aquaskimmer.mdx","yuki",{id:101,data:103,body:112,filePath:113,digest:114,legacyId:115,deferredRender:21},{title:104,imagePath:105,description:106,metaPath:107,tags:108,date:15},"Yuki","/src/images/cover/RPi.jpg","Building an Open-Source Delta X Robot for Tomato Picking","/images/covers/RPi.jpg",[109,110,95,111],"Raspberry Pi","OpenCV","TensorFlow","## How to Build an Emotion Recognition Bot with Raspberry Pi and Google Cloud\n\nEmotion recognition technology is becoming increasingly sophisticated, and it is now possible to build a bot that can detect human emotions and respond accordingly. In this blog post, we will walk through the process of building an emotion recognition bot using a Raspberry Pi, Pi camera, Google Cloud, and OLED screens.\nThe Basics\n\n![FrontImage](/images/work/yuki/Front.jpg)\n\nThe bot will consist of three main components:\n\n    * **A Raspberry Pi**: The Raspberry Pi is a small, inexpensive computer that is perfect for this project. It will be responsible for running the software that detects facial expressions and responds with different reactions.\n    * **A Pi camera**: The Pi camera will be used to capture images of people's faces. The images will then be sent to Google Cloud for facial expression recognition.\n    * **OLED screens**: The OLED screens will be used to display the bot's reactions.\n\n## The Software\n\nThe software for the bot will be written in Python. The first step is to install the necessary libraries and modules. We will need the following libraries:\n\n    * **picamera**: This library is used to control the Pi camera.\n    * **numpy**: This library is used for mathematical operations.\n    * **tensorflow**: This library is used to train and run machine learning models.\n    * **google-cloud-vision**: This library is used to interact with the Google Cloud Vision API.\n\nOnce the libraries are installed, we can start writing the code. The first step is to initialize the Raspberry Pi camera and OLED screens. Then, we can load the facial expression recognition model from Google Cloud. Finally, we can start a loop that detects facial expressions and responds with different reactions.\n\nThe reactions that the bot can display are:\n\n    **Happy**: The bot will create a set of arcs on it screens depecting it's partially closing eyes and expressing it's happy.\n\n![Happy](/images/work/yuki/Reaction.jpg)\n\n## How it works\n\n![Yuki](/images/work/yuki/Yuki.png)\n\n    * *Capturing Images* - Yuki uses RpiCamera to capture images and feed it to the Raspberry pi Zero W.\n    * *Face Detection* - On the feeded stream of video to the RPi, it uses the HaarCascade and OpenCV to detect Human Frontal Face[^1].\n    * *Detecting Emotions* - On sucessful detection of human frontal face on the camera, forward the frame to the Google Cloud Vision[^2] to detect the emotion.\n    * *Yuki Response* - Based on the response from the Google Cloud Vision and it's detection, Yuki responses with a relevent expression.\n\n## The Conclusion\n\nThis project is a great way to learn about facial expression recognition, Raspberry Pi, Google Cloud, and OLED screens. The bot can be used as a companion to help people feel better and improve their psychological state. It can also be used for research purposes to study human emotions.\n\nIn addition to the basic components and reactions described above, here are some other things you can add to your emotion recognition bot project:\n\n    More emotions: You can train the bot to recognize more emotions, such as surprise, fear, and disgust.\n    Different reactions: You can also add different reactions to the bot, such as making different facial expressions, playing different sounds, or saying different words.\n    Portability: You can make the bot more portable by using a battery pack to power it. This way, you can take the bot with you wherever you go.\n    Speech recognition: You can add speech recognition to the bot so that it can respond to your voice commands. This can make the bot more interactive and user-friendly.\n\nI hope you enjoyed this blog post!\n\n---\n\n[^1]: [Haar Cascade Object Detection Face & Eye OpenCV Python Tutorial](https://pythonprogramming.net/haar-cascade-face-eye-detection-python-opencv-tutorial/)\n\n[^2]: [Use Google cloud Vision on Raspberry Pi](https://www.dexterindustries.com/howto/use-google-cloud-vision-on-the-raspberry-pi/)","src/content/work/Yuki.mdx","11b7ea18c8a508d4","Yuki.mdx","delta-x",{id:116,data:118,body:125,filePath:126,digest:127,legacyId:128,deferredRender:21},{title:119,imagePath:120,description:106,date:121,metaPath:122,tags:123},"Delta X Robot","/src/images/cover/deltax.jpg","Aug 10, 2023","/images/covers/deltax.jpg",[124,110],"Arduino","## Building an Open-Source Delta X Robot for Tomato Picking\n\nThe agriculture industry is a major source of income for many families in India. However, the cost of agricultural equipment can be prohibitive for many farmers, especially those with middle incomes. This is especially true for equipment like tomato pickers, which can be very expensive.\n\nTo address this problem, we as a team have developed the Delta X robot. The Delta X robot is an open-source, 3D-printed tomato picker that is much more affordable than commercial tomato pickers. The robot uses a camera and OpenCV to detect ripe tomatoes, and then picks them and places them in a basket.\n\nThis blog post will provide a step-by-step guide on how to build your own Delta X robot. The instructions are intended for beginners, so no prior experience with robotics is necessary.\n\n## Prerequisites\n\nBefore you start building your Delta X robot, you will need the following:\n\n    * A 3D printer\n    * A computer with a Linux operating system\n    * The following software:\n        * OpenCV\n        * Python\n        * Git\n\n### Step 1: Design the Robot\n\nThe first step is to design the robot. You can use a CAD program like SolidWorks or Fusion 360 to design the robot's frame and parts. The robot's frame should be made of strong material, such as aluminum or steel. The parts of the robot can be made of 3D-printed plastic. For Starter the list of components and 3d files can be found [here](https://code.swecha.org/agriculture/delta-robot/delta-agricultural-robot/-/tree/main/STL-files)\n\n### Step 2: 3D Print the Parts\n\nOnce you have designed the robot, you can 3D print the parts. The parts can be printed on any 3D printer, but a high-quality printer with a large build volume is recommended. For our instance we used **Ender 3 Pro** to print the parts using PLA fillament.\n\n\n### Step 3: Assemble the Robot\n\nOnce the parts are printed, you can assemble the robot. The assembly instructions are included in the Delta X robot repository.\n\n![Work](/images/work/delta-x/assemble.jpg)\n### Step 4: Install the Software\n\nThe Delta X robot software is open-source and can be found [here](https://code.swecha.org/agriculture/delta-robot/delta-agricultural-robot). The software includes the following components:\n    * A Firmware program that runs on the robot's computer [Program](https://www.deltaxrobot.com/p/download.html)\n    * A camera program that uses OpenCV to detect tomatoes\n    * A picking program that controls the robot's arm\n\n### Step 5: Calibrate the Robot\n\nOnce the software is installed, you need to calibrate the robot. The calibration process ensures that the robot can accurately detect tomatoes and pick them. The calibration process is described in the Delta X robot repository.\n\n### Step 6: Test the Robot\n\nOnce the robot is calibrated, you can test it. The test process involves placing tomatoes in front of the robot and seeing if it can accurately detect and pick them.\n\n### Step 7: Deploy the Robot\n\nOnce the robot is tested and working properly, you can deploy it in your tomato field. The robot can be used to pick tomatoes 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.\n\n![Assembled](/images/work/delta-x/assembled.jpeg)\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe Delta X robot is a valuable tool for tomato farmers. It is affordable, precise, and easy to maintain. This makes it a great option for farmers who are looking for a way to improve their yields and profits.\n\nThe Delta X robot is still under development, but it has the potential to revolutionize tomato farming in India. The robot is more affordable, precise, and easy to maintain than commercial tomato pickers. This makes it a great option for farmers who are looking for a way to improve their yields and profits.\n\nThe team of engineers and farmers who developed the Delta X robot are working to improve the robot even further. They are working on making the robot faster, more precise, and easier to use. They are also working on developing new applications for the robot, such as picking other fruits and vegetables.\n\n\n\nThe Delta X robot is a promising new technology that has the potential to make a significant impact on the agriculture industry in India and around the world.","src/content/work/delta-x.mdx","062505a4a3548c1b","delta-x.mdx","about",["Map",129,131],{id:129,data:132,body:136,filePath:137,digest:138,legacyId:139,deferredRender:21},{title:133,description:134,imagePath:135},"Greeting Humans!!","This is the page where I explain about me and my experience.","/src/images/aboutHero.jpg","## [Skills](#skills)\n\n* **Languages**: Java, Python, C/C++,TypeScript , JavaScript, HTML/CSS\n* **Frameworks**: React, Node.js, Flask, Django, React.js, Flutter\n* **Developer Tools**: Git, Docker, Google Cloud Platform, VS Code, PyCharm, 3D Printing, IoT (Raspberry Pi, Arduino)\n* **Libraries**: pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, TensorFlow, OpenCV, paho mqtt\n\n\n## [Certification](#certification)\n*   #### Google Cloud Skills Boost - Google Cloud Career Practitioner (Jan 2023)\n    ***Skills***: Cloud Computing(Terraform, Kubernetes, Resources, Environment)\n\n\n## [Experience](#experience)\n\n* #### Seanergy Digital (Aug 2024 - present)\n    * ***Job Profile***: Associate Engineer\n    * ***Skills***: Django REST framework, Python, Poetry\n    * ***Role***:\n        Working with a team of individuals with diverse expertise to engineer various API endpoints, and accommodating clients requirements.\n\n* #### Seanergy Digital (Oct 2023 - May 2024)\n    * ***Job Profile***: Intern\n    * ***Skills***: TypeScript, Stylediv, Django REST framework\n    * ***Role***:\n        * Engineered a responsive view for the hospital management system in collaboration with a team of 6, accommodating diverse resolutions.\n        * Created various endpoints and unit tests using Django Rest Framework for a healthcare and hospital management platform.    \n* #### DigiQuanta IT Services LLP (Mar 2023 - Jun 2023)\n    * ***Job Profile***: Developer Intern\n    * ***Skills***: Arduino, Electronics, 3D Printing\n    * ***Role***:\n        Constructing a Delta robot which will assist in sorting tomatoes according to their quality.
